Notes: 
This is only the basic wireframe on the main components of the app. Our group will further expand on these areas as we go through developing this app because we will learn more of how we want to structure it as we go through the development process. This wireframe is mainly the initial groundwork we have laid out for our app, which we will build upon.

## Notes
CrunchE is designed to aid restaurant management in various facets of restaurant work. It is designed to make the process of ordering, managing staff and keeping track of sales a much easier process. A restaurant workforce has to deal with many issues in it's day to day job, so our app is meant to make the work life easier for the manager and the rest of the staff.
